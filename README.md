# Hello, I'm Sophia!
I'm currently a Math/BBA double degree student at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University. Welcome to my page!

## Highlights
- I did a [deep-dive into the Big Five](https://zhusophia.github.io/bigfive/data.html) and analyzed 1 million rows of data using R. I think it's super cool that I can combine data + psych into - two of my current interests.
- I'm really proud of the first section (page?) of [my website](zhusophia.github.io), where the user has to interact with page before being 'allowed' to see the rest of the content. Encouraging interaction and engagement makes it fun :)
  
## To-Do (2024)
- I want to become more consistent when working on projects. One of my goals this year is to *not* cram all my projects at once... let's hope that my Github contribution graph reflects that...
- Learn with/from my friends. I geniunely know so many amazing coders and I want to use them as inspiration as I look for things to pursue and projects to focus on! 

As for project goals: 
- Finish my Big Five project. I want to continue doing research and adding my findings onto the 'Beyond the Dataset' page.
- Start and finish a new project that takes more than 2 months of dedicated work. I don't really know which project -- there are so many interesting ideas! -- I would take on, but I think it'd be a really great learning opportunity to work on something (relatively) long-term
